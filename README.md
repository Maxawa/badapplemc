# badapplemc
Bad Apple in minecraft using only commands in a datapack
bad apple folder = all the original frames of the animation
bad apple resize folder = all the resized frames (from 1440x1080 to 20x15)
functionsmc = all the generated functions. you can put them in a datapack and run badapple_000.mcfunction to run run the rest in order. Dont load too many functions in at once or it'll crash (I can handle 2.5k at once)
resizeimages.py and particlegen.py are self explanatory. If you're trying to use them, make sure to change the paths in the code.
